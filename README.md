# VidHarm: A dataset for detection of harmful content in video

## Info

Splits for the dataset are available in this repo. They are lists with dictionary entries saved in json format.
Each entry has the following keys:

* filename: The unique id of the clip
* label: A single or list of labels from the label set ("BT,"7","11","15")
* total_frames: The total number of frames in the clip (this number is adapted to the preprocessed dataset which will be released at a later time)
  
## Download links

## Raw Clips
Download will be shortly made available, leave an issue here on the repo if you are interested in early access.

The clips are encoded in mostly h264. The folder structure is:

```bash
├── clips
│   ├── ID_FIRST
│   │   ├── ID_FIRST.mp4
│   ...
│   ├── ID_LAST
│   │   ├── ID_LAST.mp4
```

## Preprocessed Images and Audio
Since online video learning can be very CPU intensive we will also provide a preprocessed dataset containing each clip split into individual frames (jpeg encoded) + an additional log mel spectrogram for the audio.

```bash
├── preprocced_clips
│   ├── ID_FIRST
│   │   ├── ID_FIRST_1.jpg
|   |   ...
│   │   ├── ID_FIRST_N.jpg
│   │   ├── ID_FIRST.npy
│   │   ├── ID_FIRST.wav
│   ...
│   ├── ID_LAST
│   │   ├── ID_LAST_1.jpg
|   |   ...
│   │   ├── ID_LAST_N.jpg
│   │   ├── ID_LAST.npy
│   │   ├── ID_LAST.wav
```
